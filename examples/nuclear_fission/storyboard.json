In fact, when an atomic nucleus breaks apart, releasing a tremendous amount of energy in the process, we call that fission. It's like a nuclear explosion going off inside the atom.\n\n--- Visual Description ---\nIllustrate this scene with a dynamic animation showing two uranium-235 (U-235) atoms colliding and then splitting apart, releasing energy in the form of light and particles. The U-235 atoms should be represented as small, glowing spheres that \"snap\" into two smaller atoms, releasing radiation and kinetic energy in all directions. To emphasize the idea of energy release, you could depict tiny sparks or flashes of light radiating from the splitting atoms.
