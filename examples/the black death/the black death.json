But what caused this catastrophic outbreak? Was it just a coincidence that a deadly plague occurred at a time when the population was already vulnerable due to climate change and social unrest?\n\n--- Visual Description ---\nIllustrate a medieval cityscape with people going about their daily lives, such as merchants haggling in markets, farmers tending to fields, and artisans working on crafts. In the background, show hints of environmental stress: rivers running dry, crops wilting, and weather patterns gone awry. Perhaps include some subtle visuals like smoke rising from burning forests or a darkening sky with lightning bolts. The scene should convey the sense of unease and vulnerability that characterized medieval Europe during this time."

This phenomenon is called a compound disaster, and it can have devastating consequences for people and the environment.\n\n--- Visual Description ---\nIllustrate a dramatic scene with swirling clouds, strong winds blowing trees sideways, and a massive wildfire raging in the background.

This period of cooler temperatures had far-reaching consequences for the continent's weather patterns.\n\n--- Visual Description ---\nThe scene opens with a swirling storm cloud dominating the center of the frame, its billowy tendrils stretching out like ghostly fingers towards various regions of Europe. Arrows of different lengths and thicknesses emerge from the cloud, pointing to areas such as the British Isles, Scandinavia, and Eastern Europe. The arrows are depicted in varying shades of blue, with some appearing thicker and more robust than others, indicating the relative intensity of the factors contributing to the stormy weather.

For instance, quarantine zones became standard practice in many cities, helping to contain future outbreaks. But perhaps most surprisingly, the Black Death played a role in the rise of modern capitalism.\n\n--- Visual Description ---\nFor this scene, illustrate a medieval city with a large quarantine zone marked out, possibly with a sign reading \"Quarantine Zone\" or something similar. In the background, show people going about their daily business as usual, to highlight the contrast between life inside and outside the quarantine area. Use warm colors for the city, with some subtle hints of decay and rebuilding efforts.
