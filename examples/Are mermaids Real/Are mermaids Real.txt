--- Narration ---
As we explore the evolution of marine mammals, let's dive into their ancient past. Over 50 million years ago, early ancestors of dolphins and whales still had legs! These primitive creatures were likely small, furry, and more like otters than the sleek swimmers we know today.

--- Visual Description ---
Illustrate a series of interconnected scenes showcasing key stages in marine mammal evolution:

1. A small, quadrupedal creature (about the size of a raccoon) with limbs and a furry body, set against a terrestrial background.
2. The same creature, now slightly larger, but with its front legs morphing into flippers or paws, surrounded by water.
3. A more streamlined version of this early marine mammal, with a reduced pelvis and leg bones, swimming in the ocean alongside ancient fish.
4. As we fast-forward through time, show a transition to fully aquatic mammals, with flippers and a streamlined body, still relatively small compared to modern cetaceans.
